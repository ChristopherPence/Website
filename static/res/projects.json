					"body": "Our solution to this problem was to create an interactive campus map that allows users to search locations on campus and show the location on the map. The map is based on the open source Leaflet API, making it low maintenance and free, and easy for future developers to work on. The site also allows users to search by abbreviation or nickname, making it easier for users who are unfamiliar to campus lingo to find locations."

Even if they wish they could find more people to study with, they will opt to studying with a very close friend group, or nobody at all. We believe that it is necessary to reduce the difficulty for students to meet up on campus for studying."
